=head1 NAME

Test::XML::Count - Perl extension for testing element count at a certain depth

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::XML::Count tests => 8;

 my $xml = "<foo><bar/><bar/><bar/></foo>";

 # These will pass
 xml_node_count $xml, '/foo', 1;
 xml_node_count $xml, '/foo/bar', 3;
 xml_max_nodes $xml, '/foo', 1;
 xml_min_nodes $xml, '/foo/bar' 3;

 # These will fail
 xml_node_count $xml, '/foo', 10;
 xml_node_count $xml, '/article', 1; # need an article
 xml_min_nodes $xml, '/foo/bar', 10; # at least 10 <bar>'s in <foo>
 xml_max_nodes $xml, '/foo/bar', 1;  # at MOST 1 <bar> in <foo>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This test module allows you to check XML element counts.  This is useful in
testing applications which generate XML against known source data.  At The New 
York Times, we use it during development to quickly verify that our RSS feeds 
meet very basic structural standards. For example, every news article needs to have exactly one of each of headline, byline, date and text, and B<at least> 
one image.

This module fills a gap in L<Test::XML::Simple>, which only has facilities to
verify that an element exists (but not how many of it exist as direct siblings).
This is a great way to validate the structure of your XML documents without 
doing any deep (SLOW) comparison.  It also avoids having to hard code fragile 
element values that may change between tests or over time.  Use 
L<Test::XML::Count> in conjunction with your existing XML testing tools -- 
L<SEE ALSO>.

tool, and graciously donated to the Perl community.  To show your support for
our open source intiative you may send an email to L<mailto://open@nytimes.com>

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over 4

=item xml_node_count $xml, $xpath, $count, $name;

Test passes if the XML string in C<$xml> contains C<$count> of the element
specified by the XPath in C<$xpath>.  Optionally name the test with C<$name>.

=item xml_min_nodes $xml, $xpath, $count, $name;

Test passes if the XML string in C<$xml> contains at least C<$count> of the 
element specified by the XPath in C<$xpath>.  Optionally name the test with 
C<$name>.

=item xml_max_nodes $xml, $xpath, $count, $name;

Test passes if the XML string in C<$xml> contains at most C<$count> of the 
element specified by the XPath in C<$xpath>.  Optionally name the test with 
C<$name>.
