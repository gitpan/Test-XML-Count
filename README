Test-XML-Count version 0.01
===========================

This is a testing module that enables you to quickly verify the
number of occurances that a given element has at a given depth in
an XML document.  For example, you can use it as a validation test
to ensure than <foo>...</foo> appears at least 4 times at some
specific location in your XML document. Alternatively you can
ensure that the element occured exactly some number of times, or
at most some number of times.

Element locations are specified in XPATH, which is basically a
directory-structure-like XML path specification (e.g. a/b/c
would point to any/all <c/> located at <a><b><c/><b/><a/>).

It's a basic test, yes.  It is important to realize that basic
tests should be the basis of any comprehensive and complete test
suite.
